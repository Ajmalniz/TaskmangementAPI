# KWL Method Lesson Planner

Create effective, curriculum-aligned lesson plans using the KWL (Know-Want-Learned) teaching strategy for Sindh Textbook Board classes 6-10.

## KWL Method Overview

The KWL strategy is a three-phase instructional framework:

- **K (Know)**: Activate students' prior knowledge about the topic
- **W (Want)**: Generate questions about what students want to learn
- **L (Learned)**: Reflect on and document what students have learned

This method promotes active learning, student engagement, and metacognitive awareness.

## How to Use This Skill

When the user requests a lesson plan:

1. **Gather essential information** (if not provided):
   - Subject and specific topic
   - Class/grade level (6-10)
   - Learning objectives
   - Any specific curriculum requirements

2. **Review Sindh Board alignment**: Read `references/sindh-board-alignment.md` for curriculum standards, grade-level considerations, and subject-specific guidelines.

3. **Generate the lesson plan** using the template structure below, ensuring:
   - Maximum 2 pages when formatted
   - Designed for 40-minute class period
   - Clear, concise language
   - Practical and implementable
   - Aligned with Sindh Board curriculum

4. **Save the lesson plan** automatically to a file using the Write tool:
   - Create a descriptive filename using format: `class[X]-[topic-name]-lesson-plan.md`
   - Example: `class6-kinds-of-noun-lesson-plan.md` or `class9-photosynthesis-lesson-plan.md`
   - Replace spaces with hyphens in topic name
   - Keep filename lowercase for consistency
   - Save in the current working directory

5. **Output confirmation** with the file path where the lesson plan was saved.

## Lesson Plan Template Structure

Use this structure for all KWL lesson plans:

```markdown

*Note: Align with Bloom's Taxonomy appropriate for grade level*

## Materials Required
- [Textbook, page numbers]
- [Board/markers/chalk]
- [Handouts, charts, or other materials]
- [Any other resources needed]

## Lesson Procedure

### Phase 1: K - What We KNOW (8-10 minutes)

**Introduction & Prior Knowledge Activation**
- [Brief activity or question to introduce topic]
- [How you'll elicit what students already know]

**K-Column Recording**
- Create K-W-L chart on board with three columns
- Ask: "What do you already know about [topic]?"
- Record student responses in K column
- [Note any misconceptions to address]

**Expected K responses**:
- [Example 1 of prior knowledge]
- [Example 2 of prior knowledge]
- [Example 3 of prior knowledge]

### Phase 2: W - What We WANT to Learn (5-7 minutes)

**Question Generation**
- Ask: "What do you want to learn about [topic]?"
- Guide students to form questions using: Who, What, When, Where, Why, How

**W-Column Recording**
- Record student questions in W column
- [Highlight questions that align with learning objectives]

**Expected W questions**:
- [Example question 1]
- [Example question 2]
- [Example question 3]

### Phase 3: Main Instruction (18-20 minutes)

**Teaching Activities** (Address the W questions):

1. **[Activity/Explanation 1]** (Time: ___ min)
   - [Specific teaching method: lecture, demonstration, discussion, etc.]
   - [Key points to cover]

2. **[Activity/Explanation 2]** (Time: ___ min)
   - [Interactive element or practice]
   - [Student involvement]

3. **[Activity/Explanation 3]** (Time: ___ min)
   - [Application or example]
   - [Clarification of difficult concepts]

**Key Concepts to Cover**:
- [Concept 1 with brief explanation]
- [Concept 2 with brief explanation]
- [Concept 3 with brief explanation]

### Phase 4: L - What We LEARNED (7-10 minutes)

**Learning Reflection**
- Ask: "What did we learn today?"
- Have students share their learning
- Record responses in L column

**L-Column Recording** (Expected responses):
- [Learning point 1]
- [Learning point 2]
- [Learning point 3]

**Quick Assessment**:
- [1-2 quick questions to check understanding]
- [OR brief activity to demonstrate learning]

### Closure (2-3 minutes)

**Summary**
- [Recap main points briefly]
- [Connect to next lesson if applicable]

**Homework Assignment**
- [Clear, specific assignment that reinforces learning]
- [Textbook exercises or other activities]

## Assessment

**Formative Assessment** (During lesson):
- Observation of K-W-L participation
- Quality of questions in W phase
- Responses during main instruction
- Accuracy of L phase reflections

**Learning Outcomes Check**:
- [ ] Students can [objective 1]
- [ ] Students can [objective 2]
- [ ] Students can [objective 3]

## Differentiation Strategies
- **For advanced learners**: [Extension activity or deeper question]
- **For struggling learners**: [Simplified explanation or additional support]
- **For diverse learning styles**: [Visual/auditory/kinesthetic elements included]

## Teacher's Notes

## Essential Guidelines

### Time Management
Stick to recommended timing:
- K phase: 8-10 minutes (avoid spending too long)
- W phase: 5-7 minutes (focused question generation)
- Main instruction: 18-20 minutes (bulk of teaching)
- L phase: 7-10 minutes (critical reflection time)
- Closure: 2-3 minutes (wrap up)

**Never skip the L phase** - it's essential for metacognitive learning.

### Two-Page Limit
To stay within 2 pages:
- Use bullet points, not paragraphs
- Be specific but concise
- Include only essential information
- Use tables where helpful
- Remove any redundant content

### Grade-Appropriate Content

**Classes 6-7**:
- Simple language and concrete examples
- More collaborative K-W-L discussion
- Shorter, more varied activities
- Focus on foundational concepts

**Classes 8-9**:
- Introduce abstract concepts gradually
- Encourage independent thinking
- Balance teacher-led and student-centered activities
- Develop analytical skills

**Class 10**:
- Align with SSC examination patterns
- Include exam-relevant practice
- Develop comprehensive understanding
- Connect to real-world applications

### Subject-Specific Adaptations

For detailed subject-specific guidelines (Science, Math, languages, Social Studies), refer to `references/sindh-board-alignment.md`.

**Quick tips**:
- **Science**: Include demonstrations or experiments where possible
- **Math**: Include worked examples and practice problems
